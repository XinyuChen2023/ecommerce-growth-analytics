# E-commerce Growth Analytics: Understanding Sales, Retention & Customer Value

## Executive Summary
This project analyzes e-commerce performance data — sourced from a Shopify store but structured to reflect broader digital retail operations — with the goal of identifying key growth drivers, conversion bottlenecks, and retention opportunities across the customer lifecycle.

By combining data analytics, business intelligence, and performance marketing frameworks, the analysis aims to answer three strategic questions:

What factors most influence customer acquisition cost (CAC) and lifetime value (LTV)?

Where do users drop off in the purchase funnel, and how can conversion be improved?

How do retention cohorts behave over time, and what strategies can extend customer lifetime?

The dataset includes sales, customer, and marketing channel data integrated through SQL and analyzed using Python and BI tools such as Looker Studio and Power BI. Through descriptive, diagnostic, and predictive analyses, this project uncovers patterns in customer segmentation, channel efficiency, and order behavior, and develops data-informed recommendations for sustainable e-commerce growth.

Deliverables include a KPI dashboard, Python-based data pipeline, and executive report outlining actionable insights for marketing, retention, and revenue optimization.
